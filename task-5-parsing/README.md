# Task 5: Parsing

Parsing is the process of converting data from one format to another. In this task, you will learn how to use ChatGPT to parse data from one format to another.

# Instructions

When working with weird data, either from clients or APIs. You sometimes just wanna convert it to a more usable format, example Typescript types or classes.

This is where parsing comes in.

In ChatGPT you can attach files to your messages, and then you can reference them in your prompts.

## Examples to test

We're going take our weather.json and convert it to Typescript types.

Example prompt:

Attach the weather.json file to your message, then you can reference it in your prompt like this:
"Can you help me convert this weather.json to Typescript types?"
