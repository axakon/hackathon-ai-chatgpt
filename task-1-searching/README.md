# Task 1: Searching

ChatGPT is a powerful tool for searching and retrieving information. In this task, you will learn how to use ChatGPT to search for information and retrieve it.

# Instructions

Using ChatGPT as a search engine could be a very powerful tool, especially if you combine it with regular search engines.

Let's imagine the scenario where you are looking for some certain information, but you don't really know what it's called or a good way to have Google understand it.

You can use ChatGPT to construct your search query and then utilize Google.


## Examples to test

Next month we're going to be looking at Infrastructure as Code, and a very common tool for this is Terraform. However, when creating infrastructure you often need to store you state in a remote location.

While this scenario is very public in Terraform's documentation, a "beginner" might struggle to find it.

We want you to use ChatGPT to structure a search query that would help you find this information.


Example prompts could be:

"Help me write a Google query that returns information on different providers in Terraform where I can store my state."

or

"In Terraform you can store your state in a remote location, I wanna find more information on this, especially different providers. Can you help me Google it?"

Why ChatGPT is powerful is because it's got an "agent like" behavior, the bottom query is most likely going to end up with ChatGPT doing the "googling" for you and return the results.
