# Pair Programming Task with ChatGPT

## Objective
In this task, you will pair program with ChatGPT to build a TypeScript function that extracts the most frequent word from a given string, ignoring common stopwords like "the," "and," etc.

The goal is to collaborate with ChatGPT in real time by breaking down the problem, writing code, debugging, and improving the solution together.

---

## Problem Statement
You need to write a function `mostFrequentWord(text: string, stopwords: string[]): string` that:
1. Takes a string of text as input.
2. Ignores common stopwords (e.g., "the", "and", "is").
3. Returns the most frequent word that is not a stopword.

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Break Down the Problem
Start by asking ChatGPT how to approach this problem in TypeScript. You could ask questions like:
- "How should I process the input text in TypeScript?"
- "What data structures would be useful for counting word frequencies?"

> **Goal:** Get an outline or approach from ChatGPT that includes how to:
> - Clean the input text (e.g., remove punctuation).
> - Remove stopwords.
> - Count the frequencies of the remaining words.

---

### Step 2: Write the Initial Function
Once you have an approach, ask ChatGPT to help you write the function in TypeScript.

Example prompts:
- "Can you help me write a TypeScript function to count word frequencies?"
- "How do I remove common stopwords from a string in TypeScript?"

> **Goal:** Collaboratively write a function that processes the input string, removes stopwords, and returns the most frequent word.

---

### Step 3: Debug and Improve the Function
Run the initial function and check if it works. If there are issues or edge cases to address, ask ChatGPT for debugging help.

Example prompts:
- "The function doesn’t work for punctuation marks like periods or commas. How can I fix that?"
- "How can I handle case sensitivity so that 'Word' and 'word' are treated the same?"

> **Goal:** Improve the function by handling edge cases like punctuation, case sensitivity, or other common issues.

---

### Step 4: Testing
Ask ChatGPT to help you create a few test cases for your function.

Example prompts:
- "What test cases should I try for this function?"
- "Can you help me write tests using Jest in TypeScript?"

> **Goal:** Test your function on various inputs to ensure it works as expected.

---

### Step 5: Code Review
Once your function is working, ask ChatGPT to review it for any potential improvements.

Example prompts:
- "Can you review my code for best practices?"
- "Is there a way to make this function more efficient?"

> **Goal:** Refine the code and ensure it follows TypeScript and JavaScript best practices.

---

## Deliverables
- A TypeScript function `mostFrequentWord(text: string, stopwords: string[]): string`.
- At least 3 test cases demonstrating the function’s accuracy.
