# Task 2: Documentation

Documentation is an important part of any project. In this task, you will learn how to use ChatGPT to read and understand documentation.

# Instructions

If you tested the last query in Task 1, you might have noticed that ChatGPT sometimes does other things then just return chat results.

This is because ChatGPT can do more than just chat, it can also do other things.

In this task you will learn how to use ChatGPT to read and understand documentation.

## Examples to test

We wanna use OpenAI's API to create a chatbot that can answer questions about the OpenAI API.

Instead of reading through the documentation, we can just point ChatGPT towards the documentation and then ask it questions.

Example prompts could be:

"
Can you read though https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference" documentation and help me answer a few questions.

First off, what type of models are available?
I need a model that can generate JSON output from text input, what should I choose?

Can you give me an example on how to call this API using bash?
"

Then you can follow up with more questions like

"How can I get an API key? "

"Can you give me an example on how to call this API using python?"
